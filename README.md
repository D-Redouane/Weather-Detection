# Weather-Classification
Training a computer vision model to detect different types of weather conditions such as dew, fogsmog, frost etc
# Overview
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting different conditions of weather using images. The model utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze visual data and identify patterns associated with wildfire occurrences. The goal is to provide an effective tool for detection and monitoring of weather conditions. The pictures are divided into 11 classes: dew, fog/smog, frost, glaze, hail, lightning , rain, rainbow, rime, sandstorm and snow.

# Dataset
This repository focuses on weather classification using a curated dataset. The dataset contains a collection of weather-related conditions.

The dataset contains labeled 6862 images of different types of weather. The dataset is organized to facilitate the training and evaluation of machine learning models for weather classification tasks. With labeled data indicating different weather conditions (such as fog, dew, rainy, etc.), this dataset serves as a valuable resource for building accurate classifiers.
